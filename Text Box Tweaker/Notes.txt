Hi everyone

 This is one nice module that I've made to assist Data Validation as the user types in the
text box, but It cannot be trusted though as the user might trick the text box into not
validating typed keys by not typing them!
 if he paste whatever right in the text box. The _KeyPress event is not fired. You might
want to get over this using some API function that disables popup menu for the text box
so that user cannot paste anything into it.



Sub Syntax & Usage
------------------

Private Sub Text1_KeyPress(KeyAscii as Integer)

	Tweak txt (As TextBox), _
	      KeyAscii (As Integer), _
              Mode (As eTweakMode), _
	      Optional iDecimalPlaces (As Integer = 2), _
              Optional sBannedSet (As String), _
	      Optional sAllowedSet (As String)

End Sub



txt:		text box to tweak

KeyAscii:	the KeyAscii Passed by the _KeyPress Event

Mode:		one of 14 modes supported

iDecimalPlaces:	Number of Decimal Places desired (Default =2)

sBannedSet:	a String Variable that contains characters that should be banned
		use this with the [Normal] Mode to Prevent certain keys

sAllowedKeys:	a String Variable that contains characters that should be allowed
		use with any mode to Allow keys that are banned by that mode
